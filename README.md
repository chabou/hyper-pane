module.exports = {
  config: {
    // other configs...
    paneNavigation: {
      debug: false,
      hotkeys: {
        navigation: {
          up: 'ctrl+alt+up',
          down: 'ctrl+alt+down',
          left: 'ctrl+alt+left',
          right: 'ctrl+alt+right'
        },
        jump_prefix: 'ctrl+alt', // completed with 1-9 digits
        permutation_modifier: 'shift', // Added to jump and navigation hotkeys for pane permutation
        maximize: 'meta+enter'
      },
      showIndicators: true, // Show pane number
      indicatorPrefix: '^⌥', // Will be completed with pane number
      indicatorStyle: { // Added to indicator <div>
        position: 'absolute',
        top: 0,
        left: 0,
        fontSize: '10px'
      },
      focusOnMouseHover: false,
      inactivePaneOpacity: 0.6 // Set to 1 to disable inactive panes dimming
      activePaneOpacity: 1,
      inactivePaneBackground: 'transparent', // Set to color to have a different background for an active pane
      activePaneBackground: 'transparent' // Set to color to have a different background for an inactive pane

    }
  }
  //...
};
```
### Supported keys
For modifier keys you can use `shift`, `ctrl`, `alt`, or `meta`. You can substitute `option` for `alt` and `command` for `meta`.

Other special keys are `backspace`, `tab`, `enter`, `return`, `capslock`, `esc`, `escape`, `space`, `pageup`, `pagedown`, `end`, `home`, `left`, `up`, `right`, `down`, `ins`, `del`, and `plus`.

Any other key you should be able to reference by name like `a`, `/`, `$`, `*`, or `=`.

**⚠ Warning**: Use `ctrl+alt` or `cmd+alt` modifier only with arrow and digit key. Otherwise, shortcut will not be detected by Hyper.

## Usage
### Navigation with arrows

Use `ctrl+alt+<Up,Down,Left,Right>` (or your configured hotkeys) to navigate to a neighbor pane.

### Jump with digit

Use `ctrl+alt+<1-9>` (or your configured hotkeys) to jump directly to a numbered pane.
Panes are ordered "first child descendent" and `9` is reserved to the last pane.

Hotkey indicators are displayed on top left corner of each pane from 2 panes opened.
You can change its content, its style or hide them completly.

### Pane permutation

Adding `shift` key (or your configured key) to previous hotkeys cause a pane switching.

### Focus on mouse hover

Set `config.paneNavigation.focusOnMouseHover` to `true` and focus will change when mouse cursor enters into an another pane.

### Maximize a pane

You can temporarily maximize pane with `meta+enter` (or your configured key) and restore it with the same key.
You can have one maximized pane per tab.

### Dim inactive panes

By default, inactive panes are dimmed (opacity: 0.6).
You can disable this by setting `inactivePaneOpacity` to `1`.

### Dim active pane

By default, active panes are not dimmed (opacity: 1).
You can change this by setting `activePaneOpacity` to `numericValue`.

### Pane backgrounds

By default, inactive and active panes don't have a background color (background: transparent).
You can change the background color of active/inactive pane by setting `active/inactivePaneBackground` to `'colorName/HEX/rgb/'`.
